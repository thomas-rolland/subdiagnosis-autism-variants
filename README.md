# subdiagnosis-autism-variants

You will find here the python scripts developped for the post-processing analyses reported in the "Sub-diagnostic effects of genetic variants associated with autism" manuscript.

All raw genetic data are available upon request from [SFARI-base](https://sfari.org/sfari-base), [UK-Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/), and downloadable from [the Autism Sequencing Consortium](https://genome.emory.edu/ASC/) and [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/downloads). The full variant calling and quality control pipeline is described in details in the manuscript. All phenotypic data for SSC and SPARK cohorts are available upon request from [SFARI-base](https://sfari.org/sfari-base). All functioning/cognitive metrics and MRI-based brain imaging data for UK-Biobank individuals are available upon request from [UK-Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/).
